### Songs playlist app using Django
A project I built during attending this course at Educative:
Django: Python Web Development Unleashed

This project delves into the exciting realm of music playlist management, empowering you to leverage the power of databases.
A robust and well-organized system, meticulously crafted to elevate your music organization experience.

Personalize your musical sanctuary, by integrating user authentication features, allowing for secure sign-up and login functionalities.

### Project Scope
This project encompasses a series of meticulously designed tasks, outlined as follows:

1. Entity Modeling: constructed data models for songs and playlists, ensuring a well-defined structure within the database.
2. Relationship Establishment: A crucial Many-to-Many relationship is established between songs and playlists. This enables playlists to encompass a multitude of songs, while simultaneously allowing a single song to reside within multiple playlists, fostering playlist versatility.
3. User Account Creation: A user-centric sign-up form is implemented, facilitating the creation of user accounts, paving the way for the construction of your personalized music domain.
4. Secure Login System: A secure login form meticulously crafted, acting as the gateway to your musical haven.
5. Unique User Identification: To safeguard the integrity of the system, implemented robust duplicate email validation during the sign-up process, guaranteeing unique user identities.
6. User Authentication: The authenticate function has been harnessed to verify login credentials, granting authorized access to the system.
7. Data Retrieval and Display: implemented functionalities to retrieve all newly created playlists from the database, culminating in their display on the homepage, showcasing your music collection.
8. Song Information Editing: A comprehensive edit form is crafted, empowering you to edit song information, ensuring your playlists remain perfectly curated.
